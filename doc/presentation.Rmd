## COVID-19 World Vaccine Adverse Reactions
- Found on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/ayushggarg/covid19-vaccine-adverse-reactions?select=2021VAERSSYMPTOMS.csv)
- Data from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) created by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 
- Contains 3 data sets: 
    1. PATIENTS.CSV
    2. VACCINES.CSV
    3. SYMPTOMS.CSV
- Data sets connected by individual IDs (VAERS_ID)
- VAERS User Guide (https://vaers.hhs.gov/docs/VAERSDataUseGuide_November2020.pdf)
  - A guide to variable names

## COVID-19 World Vaccine Adverse Reactions
PATIENTS.CSV: Contains information about the individuals that received the vaccines

```{r echo=FALSE}
head(patients, 3)
```


## COVID-19 World Vaccine Adverse Reactions
VACCINES.CSV: Contains information about the received vaccine

```{r echo=FALSE}
as_tibble(vaccines) %>% head(., 3)
```


## COVID-19 World Vaccine Adverse Reactions
SYMPTOMS.CSV: Contains information about the symptoms experiences after vaccination

```{r echo=FALSE}
head(symptoms, 3)
```
