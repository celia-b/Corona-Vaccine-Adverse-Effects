# Final Project in Course 22100 R For Bio Data Science, Spring 2021
![](DTU_Logo_Corporate_Red_CMYK.png){width=5%}

The goal of this collaborative bio data science project is to demonstrate our ability to use Tidyverse R to perform data cleansing, transformation, visualization, and communication. The focus is on reproducibility and following the tidyverse style guide.



## The Dataset
In this project, we are working with the **COVID-19 World Vaccine Adverse Reactions** Dataset, which is available on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/ayushggarg/covid19-vaccine-adverse-reactions. The dataset comes from The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), established by The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and co-managed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It should be noted that VAERS data come from a passive surveillance system and represent unverified reports of health events that occur after vaccination with a U.S.-licensed vaccine. Therefore, reports may include incomplete, inaccurate and coincidental information.  

The raw data consists of 3 CSV files:

- 2021VAERSDATA.csv (VAERS DATA) 
- 2021VAERSSYMPTOMS.csv (VAERS Symptoms) 
- 2021VAERSVAX.csv (VAERS Vaccine)



## Project Description

Describe the following: 

- cleaning/wrangling of data using the VAERS Data Use Guide: https://vaers.hhs.gov/docs/VAERSDataUseGuide_November2020.pdf
- visualizations in ggplot
- modeling
